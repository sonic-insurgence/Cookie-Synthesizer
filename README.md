# Cookie Synthesizer

The Cookie is a small but powerful DIY synthesizer project.
It is derived from the Shruthi-1 DIY synthesizer by Émilie Gillet 
from Mutable Instruments.
Slight modifications have been carried out concerning the PCB form factor, the track layout 
and the arrangement of components.
The circuit is basically the same as the Shruthi-Digital-v08 with a Shruthi-Analog-SVF-v03 
filter board.

### User Manual
Have a look at the [user manual of the original Shruthi-1](https://mutable-instruments.net/archive/shruthi/manual/).

### Software
The Cookie provides full software compatibility with the Shruthi-1. You can flash the 
microcontroller with the original firmware from MI or with an alternative firmware by 
bjoeri.
