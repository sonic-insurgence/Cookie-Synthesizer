# Cookie Synthesizer

The Cookie is a small but powerful DIY synthesizer project.
It is derived from the Shruthi-1 DIY hybrid synthesizer by Émilie Gillet 
from Mutable Instruments. 
Slight modifications have been carried out concerning the PCB form factor, the track layout 
and the arrangement of components. 
The circuit is basically the same as the "Shruthi-Digital-v08" with a "Shruthi-Analog-SMR4-mkII-v02" 
filter board.


### User Manual
Learn how to operate your Cookie Synth by having a look at the 
[user manual of the original Shruthi-1](https://mutable-instruments.net/archive/shruthi/manual/).


### Patch Editor
There are several editors out there that can be used to tweak the sounds on your Cookie Synth. 
E. g. check out the one from 
[Ixox (Win / OS X)](https://github.com/Ixox/Shruthi-And-Ambika-Editors/releases).
You may also find a patch manager software useful to organize your many sounds. 
If you are on Windows you might give  
[ShruthiFi1_0 (Win)](https://sites.google.com/site/thesonicfunk/programs) a try, although 
I had some issues with it.


### Firmware
The Cookie provides full software compatibility with Shruthi-1. You can flash the 
microcontroller with the original firmware from MI or with an alternative firmware like 
YAM by bjoeri. The software provided in this repository is a slight modification of the latter.
